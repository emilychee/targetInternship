# How Models Work (simple)
- Divide the data into categories (make a decision tree)
- Fit the model by capturing information about the data (averages, etc)
- The nodes in the decision tree capture the different factors of the 
situation/problem you’re trying to model
    - More nodes —> more specific —> more likely to be an accurate model
    - Leaf = point at which we make a decision in a decision tree

Questions:
* When should mean be used over median and vice versa?

# Selecting Data for Modeling
- Prediction target is the y variable
- Choosing features
    - Features are the columns of the data table
    - Helps us predict the y variable

# Model Validation
- How good is your model?
- Summarizing model quality: look at mean absolute error
    - How far the model’s predicted values lie from the true values, on average
- Best to use multiple samples when training your model

# Underfitting and Overfitting
- Overfitting = model matches the training data very well but doesn’t predict 
well on real data
- Underfitting = doesn’t capture the patterns; when predictions are far off 
not only in the real data but also in the training data

# Random Forests (another type of model)
- Uses many decision trees instead of just one
- Makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree
- Usually works way better than single decision trees
